# rexjs - platform agnostic data binding
`rexjs` is a highly extensible and framework-agnostic javascript library for platform-agnostic data binding and value propogation. The `rex` part means *reactive expression*.

## The problem of value propogation
Value propogation is a tricky business. We're often faced with a situation wherein one part of a program generates a value, and we want to expose that value to another part of the program, after performing several operations on it.

Consider a partial view, for example, for editting an `Employee` of a `Company`:

	Name: [      ]
    


## rexjs vs. RxJS
In spite of the similar name, `rexjs` is quite different from `RxJS` and has totally different goals. `RxJS` is concerned with event propagation while `rexjs` is concerned with value propagation.

Ultimately, they are both reactive technologies, that help you work in an asynchronous and changing world.
